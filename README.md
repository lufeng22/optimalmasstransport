# The Optimal Mass Transport for Mesh Process
Basic tools  and some demo for Optimal mass transport

## Area Preserving Mapping


## Package Dependency
- numpy==1.16.4
- matplotlib==3.0.3
- meshio==3.2.8  #meshio is used to load obj trimesh
- scipy==1.16.4



Note: This is greatly inspired by "https://github.com/cfwen/geometry-processing-package".
- The only reason we do this is because Python seems more accessible
- If you are more familary with matlab, use the original one
